# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains onboarding documentation for the Pividori Lab at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. It serves as the central hub for lab culture, expectations, procedures, and setup instructions for new lab members.

## Repository Structure

- `onboarding.md` - Main onboarding document containing lab mission, expectations, communication protocols, and development standards
- `README.md` - Overview and checklist for new lab members
- `docs/` - Supporting documentation:
  - `cu_dbmi.md` - CU Department of Biomedical Informatics setup steps
  - `code_review_checklist.md` - Code quality standards and review guidelines
  - `hardware.md` - System76 hardware support information
  - `linter_install_tutorial.md` - Pre-commit hook setup for code quality
  - `tools.md` - Available tools and services
  - `reading.md` - Recommended reading materials

## Key Lab Standards

When making changes to documentation, follow these lab principles from `onboarding.md`:

- **Simple**: Use straightforward language and avoid jargon
- **Concise**: Documents should be readable in a single sitting  
- **Specific**: Content should be targeted to the Pividori Lab
- **Enforceable**: Expectations should have clear consequences
- **Living**: Documentation is expected to change and evolve

## Modification Process

All changes must follow the lab's pull request workflow:
1. Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account
2. Make commits to your personal fork
3. Create pull request to the main `pivlab/onboarding` repository
4. For this repository specifically, Milton must approve all pull requests
5. At least one other lab member must also approve before merging

## Content Guidelines

- Maintain focus on lab-specific information rather than generic development practices
- Keep security and confidentiality requirements prominent, especially regarding CU data classification
- Update contact information and links when they change
- Preserve the comprehensive code review checklist standards that apply to all lab code repositories
- Ensure all university-specific setup instructions remain current

## Important Context

This documentation reflects the lab's commitment to reproducible research, open science, and high-quality code standards. Changes should align with the lab's mission of advancing precision medicine through machine learning and the cultural values of transparency, collaboration, and scientific rigor.
