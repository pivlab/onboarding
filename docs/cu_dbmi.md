# Setting up as a member of the CU DBMI

As a new member of the lab, you're also a member of the CU Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI).
The list below contains a series of tasks that you will likely need to complete to fully join the DBMI.

* **Request access to the [Research Informatics' Slack workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T059SDTDE14)**.
Many faculty members, postdocs and students are part of this workspace, and it is convenient to be in touch with the rest.
* **Request access to the [Alpine Cluster](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/alpine).**
If you're part of the lab, you'll likely need computational resources to run your experiments on large datasets.
* **Setup the CU VPN in your laptop**
Follow [these instructions](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology/remote-resources/tools-and-software) to set up the VPN client in your laptop so you can access different resources from CU DBMI.
* If you have a computer desktop on campus, it's convenient to **set up remote desktop software** such as [RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) for remote access.
