# Setting up as a member of the CU DBMI

As a new member of the lab, you're also a member of the CU Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI).
The list below contains a series of tasks that you will likely need to complete to fully join the DBMI.

* **Request access to the Research Informatics' Slack workspace**.
Many faculty members, postdocs and students are part of this workspace, and it is convenient to be in touch with the rest. Please contact Milton to get an invitation to it.
* **Request access to the [Alpine Cluster](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology/tools-services/HPC).**
If you're part of the lab, you'll likely need computational resources to run your experiments on large datasets.
* **Setup the CU VPN in your laptop**
Follow [these instructions](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology/remote-resources/tools-and-software) to set up the VPN client in your laptop so you can access different resources from CU DBMI.
* If you have a computer desktop on campus, it's convenient to **set up remote desktop software** such as [RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) for remote access.
* If you need to access **popular Windows apps** such as **Microsoft Office** or Adobe Acrobat that are not available in your system (i.e., you're a happy Linux user), you can use a virtual machine provided by CU at https://remote.ucdenver.edu/ by logging in using your university credentials and kicking off the "Complementary" virtual machine. The virtual machine allows to easily access your OneDrive files.
