## System76

Many folks in the lab use desktop computers from [System76](https://system76.com/), a Denver-based hardware company that builds computers running Linux.
They also have an Ubuntu-based operating system called Pop_OS!

* Go to the System76 webpage.
* Click on the Log in button at the top right corner, and then "Create account".
* Once you are logged in, go to "Support tickets" and click on "Contact Support".
* Click again on "Contact support" and then on "Enter serial number".
* Follow the steps. The contact will be through email.
