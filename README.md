# Pividori Lab Onboarding Repository

The repository is home to the onboarding information for the [Pividori Lab](https://pivlab.org/) at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

# Checklist for new lab members

It has important information about the lab's mission, expectations, lab meetings, individual meetings, source code, reproducibility, etc.
Ask if you have questions.
* As a member of the lab, you should be able to **claim a GitHub Pro account** for your personal user.
This can provide free access to **GitHub Copilot**.
Check out the [GitHub Global Campus](https://education.github.com/).

For this, we will need your GitHub user.

We need your email address to send you an invitation to join.
* **Add yourself to the [lab's team webpage](https://pivlab.org/team/)**.
For this, you need to fork the [lab's webpage GitHub repo](https://github.com/pivlab/pivlab-website), create a new branch, make the necessary changes, and then submit a Pull Request (PR).
Follow [the documentation on how to add team members](https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs/basics/team-members) and/or take a look at some PRs like [this one with a postdoc role](https://github.com/pivlab/pivlab-website/pull/4) or [this one with a PhD student role](https://github.com/pivlab/pivlab-website/pull/10).
* **Ensure your computer meets the Baseline Secure Computing Standards**.
You are likely going to work with public, confidential and/or highly confidential data (see [CU Data Classification](https://www.cu.edu/data-governance/resources-support/data-classification)).
Please, make sure your computer meets the [Baseline Secure Computing Standards](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/information-security-and-it-compliance/resources/security-management/baseline-secure-computing-standards), such as activating automatic updates, enabling the firewall, encrypting the whole disk, among many others.
