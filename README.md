# Pividori Lab Onboarding Repository

The repository is home to the onboarding information for the [Pividori Lab](https://pivlab.org/) at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

# Checklist for new lab members
* **Read the [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md) document**.
It has important information about the lab's mission, expectations, lab meetings, indiviudal meetings, source code, reproducibility, etc.
Ask if you have questions.
* As a member of the lab, you should be able to **claim a GitHub Pro account** for your personal user.
Check out the [GitHub Global Campus](https://education.github.com/).
* **Request access to the [lab's GitHub organization](https://github.com/pivlab)**.
For this, Milton will need your GitHub user.
* **Request access to the [lab's Slack workspace](https://pivlab.slack.com/)**.
It is usually a good idea to link this account to your CU email address.
* **Add yourself to the [lab's team webpage](https://pivlab.org/team/)**.
For this, you need to fork the [lab's webpage GitHub repo](https://github.com/pivlab/pivlab-website), make the necessary changes, and then submit a Pull Request (PR).
Follow [the documentation on how to add team members](https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs/basics/team-members) and/or take a look at [this PR](https://github.com/pivlab/pivlab-website/pull/4).
* (optional) **Add your recent publications to the lab's website**.
If you want visitors to know more about your research, you can add your recent publications to the lab's website.
This usually involves modifying the `_data/sources.yaml` file.
See [the documentation on citations](https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs/basics/citations) for more information.
